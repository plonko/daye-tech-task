# Daye technical task

At Daye, we customise the types and amounts of tampons given to each
customer to make sure what they are getting is right for them.

We have an API that returns a list of our packages and what’s in them. We
would like you to read the api and display it in a readable way. In
addition it would be great if you could add in some sort of filtering
mechanic based on some of the differences between the packages. As I
mentioned great user interfaces are really important
to us so keep this in mind!

The api is a bit “buggy” which causes some of the tampon lists
to be returned as a xml string rather than JSON so be careful of this,
there are some spelling mistakes in the variable names!

The api can be found here: https://front-end-test-bvhzjr6b6a-uc.a.run.app

Please don’t kill yourself over this, think of it as a chance to show off of what
you can do and how you would go about structuring a project. The project
should be in react but feel free to use whatever packages or setup you want!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
